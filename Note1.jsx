        One of the most powerful, efficient, and open-source JavaScript
        frameworks is Angular. Google operates this framework and is implemented
        to use for developing a Single Page Application (SPA). It extends the
        HTML into the application and interprets the attributes to perform data
        binding.
      </p>
    </div>

export default Note1;
